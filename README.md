Repository for presentation on: "Statistical Modeling: The two cultures" 
===

Content
--- 
This presentation compares the two cultures of statistical modeling: the data modeling culture, which assumes a stochastic process that produced the data. This culture is associated with traditional statistics. The other culture is called algorithmic modeling culture, which can be reduced to optimization of a loss function with an algorithm. This culture is associated with Machine Learning. It is argued to use algorithmic modeling more often in statistics. This presentation is heavily based on the paper ["Statistical Modeling: The two cultures" from Leo Breiman](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726)


If you like the design of the slides
--- 

The slides are compiled with [Xelatex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX). You need to have the awesome [Comfortaa font](http://www.dafont.com/comfortaa.font) installed. It is for free and did I mention that it is awesome? The slides are based on the beamer documentclass and the theme is a customized version of [this theme](https://github.com/hsrmbeamertheme/hsrmbeamertheme/). 
In the console you can simply type "xelatex presentation.tex" to compile the slides. Comment the line "\setbeameroption{show notes}" if you want to compile the slides without notes.
